### RNA-seq data processing and analysis with Salmon

This doc contains the commands and explanations for the analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing using Salmon up to DEG analysis using R/Rstudio

A few notes before gettting stared: 

1. All data and analysis should be completed in the <code>/data</code> directory of our Lab Server
due to space constraints in your individual home directories

2. Keep your files organized - this will make your life a whole lot easier. I recommend something like this: 
	- /data/projectname/rawdata
		- store your raw fasta files here
		- also consider storing a list of your sample names here
	- /data/projectname/salmon/
		- make subdirectories for the output files
		
3. Review the Linux/Bash links on the Github Page for assistance with navigating the server

4. Review [Salmon Documentation](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/getting_started/)


#### Download Data (fastq files). Below are two examples of how to download data: 

    wget http://link/to/data/.fastq.gz
	
	wget -m ftp://username:password@link/to/data
   
    wget -r -nH -nd -np http://link/to/data/.fastqz
	
	from UCSD: wget -m ftp://username:password@link/to/data/.fastq.gz>
	
	
#### Install Conda, other packages, and set up environment

-You can find information about Anaconda and Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
-Right click on the download button and click "copy link address". Paste this link after wget command (see example below) 

	wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
	
	bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

It will ask you a bunch of questions. Make sure that you use the defaults for all of them (press enter for all). Start
pressing ENTER through all the license agreements. Type 'yes' when it asks if you agree to everything. One of the
important questions it will ask during installation is if you want to add this to the PATH variable in your ~/.bashrc
Check that the anaconda bin was added to your path by looking at your bashrc file:

	less ~/.bashrc

There should be a line in there that looks something like this located BELOW the line "#User specific aliases and
functions":

	export PATH=/home/USERNAME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH

Then install necessary packges. You may need to make and activate a new conda environment in order to install new packages. 
More information about environment can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
More information about Anaconda installation can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/)

	conda install -c bioconda salmon

Remember to activate conda environment that has STAR installed

	conda activate [environment name]
	conda activate salmon
	conda info --envs #to see environments
	

#### Building Salmon reference index:

You need reference genome (fasta files) of transcriptome (cDNA)
These can be found on [UCSC Genome Browser](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#mouse) and [Gencode](https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/)
Right click on the files and click "copy link address". Download these in a directory named /references/name_of_reference_w_version_ID. 
	
	mkdir /data/jburgado_data/salmon/mm39_index
	cd /data/jburgado_data/salmon/mm39_index
	wget https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M30/gencode.vM30.transcripts.fa.gz
	salmon index -t Mus_musculus.GRCm39.cdna.all.fa.gz -i mm39_index

#### Running Salmon
	
	ls | grep .*R1> R1_names.txt # create file names for R1 and R2 files separately. This is done in the directory that contains your raw data
	ls | grep .*R2> R2_names.txt
	
	mkdir /data/jburgado_data/salmon/outputs/AgingAstrocyteTranscritpome_output #create directory for the output files
	vi salmon_AgingAstrocyteTranscriptome.sh #create script

##### The script should look something like this: 	

#!/bin/bash
while read -r f1 f2; do
        salmon quant -i /data/jburgado_data/salmon/mm39_index -l A \
        -1 <(gunzip -c /data/jburgado_data/rawdata/AgingAstrocyteTranscriptome/${f1}) \
        -2 <(gunzip -c /data/jburgado_data/rawdata/AgingAstrocyteTranscriptome/${f2}) \
        -p 8 --validateMappings \
        -o /data/jburgado_data/salmon/outputs/AgingAstrocyteTranscriptome_output/$f1
done < <(paste R1_names.txt R2_names.txt)

#### You're done!

Transfer all of the output files (easiest way is via FileZilla) to your local computer
